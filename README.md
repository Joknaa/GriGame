# GriGame
This is a curious attamp to experience the world of grid based game, to know how they work, and what are their benefits and limitations.

The scope is very simple. **The goal is to create the main systems** needed in this type of games, in a way that is **readable**, **scalable**, and generally **clean**, for future use in other projects.

Check the **project tab** for more info.
